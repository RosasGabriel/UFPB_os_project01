# First project for the discipline of Operational Systems

The project consists of the implementation of three process scaling algorithms:\
-> First Come First Server (FCFS);\
-> Shorstest Job First (SJF);\
-> Round Robin (RR) with quantum = 2;

The expected output is the acronym for each algorithm and the average value for the following paramenters:\
-> Turnaround time;\
-> Response time;\
-> Waiting time;

The detailed description for the project can be found in the trabalho01.pdf file
